TENeT Database Setup Guide
Overview
The TENeT project utilizes a lightweight SQLite database with geospatial support to manage Community Access Tier (CAT) data. This system enables the import, management, and querying of CSV and GeoJSON data without requiring PostgreSQL or PostGIS infrastructure.

Database Architecture
Table Structure
The database consists of four primary tables:
cat_regions stores geographic regions with their associated tier classifications. cat_data_points maintains individual access points including healthcare facilities, educational institutions, and transportation hubs. cat_uploads tracks file upload history and processing status. cat_gating_rules defines access control criteria organized by tier level.

File Locations
Development database: backend/data/tenet.db
Upload directory: backend/data/uploads/
Sample data: backend/data/samples/

Installation and Setup
Dependency Installation
Navigate to the backend directory and install the required dependencies:

cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
Database Initialization
Execute the initialization script to create the database schema:

python database/init_db.py
This command will create all required tables, establish three sample gating rules (Tier 1, 2, and 3), and display initial database statistics.

Sample Data Import
To test the system with sample data, use the following commands:
Import sample regions (GeoJSON format):

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/cat/upload \
-F "file=@data/samples/sample_cat_regions.geojson"
Import sample data points (CSV format):

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/cat/upload \
-F "file=@data/samples/sample_cat_data.csv"

Tier 2 (Moderate Access) encompasses suburban areas and small cities. Requirements include a minimum access score of 40.0, maximum distance of 100 kilometers, and maximum travel time of 120 minutes.
Tier 3 (Limited Access) designates rural and remote areas. Criteria include a minimum access score of 20.0, maximum distance of 200 kilometers, and maximum travel time of 180 minutes.

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/cat/gating/check \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"point_id": 1,
"tier_level": 2
}'
Expected response:

{
"allowed": true,
"passed_rules": ["Tier 2 Moderate Access"],
"failed_rules": []
}

Troubleshooting
Database Lock Errors
SQLite may encounter concurrency limitations when multiple processes attempt simultaneous write operations. Ensure that only one process performs write operations at any given time. For production environments requiring higher concurrency, consider migrating to PostgreSQL with PostGIS extensions.

Import Failures
Verify that CSV and GeoJSON files conform to the specified schema requirements. Ensure all required columns and properties are present. Confirm that coordinate values are expressed in decimal degrees using the WGS84 datum.

Performance Optimization
The database includes indexes on frequently queried fields. For large datasets exceeding 100,000 records, consider implementing additional spatial indexes. Utilize pagination for queries returning large result sets to optimize performance.

Implementation Roadmap
Customize gating rules by modifying the database/init_db.py file or utilizing the API endpoints to create custom rule sets.
Import production data by preparing CSV or GeoJSON files according to the format specifications outlined in this guide.
Develop frontend interface by connecting to the provided API endpoints for dat  a visualization and user interaction.
Implement authentication by integrating with existing authentication systems to control access and permissions.
Scale to production database by migrating to PostgreSQL with PostGIS when ready to deploy to production environments.

## CAT Gating Rules: Documentation

### Overview: CAT Classification vs. Feasibility Gating

TENeT has two distinct concepts that are often confused:

#### 1. CAT Classification (Static)
 **What**: A pre-computed tier (1 - 4) assigned to each community
 **When**: During data import from CSV files
 **Based on**: Transportation modes, infrastructure, population
 **Stored**: `CATRegion.tier_level`
 **Example**: A remote fly-in community might be classified as Tier 4
 **Purpose**: High-level categorization of access levels

#### 2. Feasibility Gating (Dynamic)
 **What**: A real-time check if a community passes tier-specific rules
 **When**: When the `/api/cat/feasibility/<region_code>` endpoint is called
 **Based on**: Current metrics (access quality, distance, travel time)
 **Stored**: Not stored - computed on demand
 **Example**: "Does this Tier 4 community actually have enough bandwidth for telehealth?"
 **Purpose**: Determine if telehealth is currently feasible

### The `priority` Field

The `priority` field on `CATGatingRule` determines **check order** when multiple rules exist for the same tier.

#### Priority Rules:
1. **Higher number = Higher priority** (checked first)

2. Rules are sorted in **descending order** (`priority.desc()`)

3. The system checks all rules (doesn't stop at first failure)

#### Current Implementation:

# get_active_gating_rules() sorts by priority descending

query = query.order_by(CATGatingRule.priority.desc()).all()

# Example: If rules have priority 3, 1, 2
# They will be checked as: 3 -> 2 -> 1


# Why Priority Matters (Future Use Case):

Currently: One rule per tier ,  priority has no practical effect

Future: Multiple rules per tier → priority determines check order
Example: Tier 1 could have:
  - Priority 3: "Urban" rule (strictest, checked first)
  - Priority 2: "Suburban" rule (medium, checked second)
  - Priority 1: "Rural" rule (least strict, checked last)

Important Note:

Do not confuse priority with tier level!

Tier 1 = Best access (least needy)

Tier 4 = Worst access (most needy)

Priority 4 = Checked first (higher number = higher priority)

Priority 4 (Highest) which  Checked FIRST
Priority 3             
Priority 2             
Priority 1 (Lowest) which Checked LAST

# How Rules Are Seeded

Rules are created in init_db.py::create_sample_gating_rules():

rules = [
    {
        'rule_name': 'Tier 1 Basic Access',
        'tier_level': 1,
        'min_access_score': 60.0,      # Strictest requirements
        'priority': 1                   # Lowest priority
    },
    {
        'rule_name': 'Tier 4 Extreme Access',
        'tier_level': 4,
        'min_access_score': CAT4_MIN_ACCESS_SCORE,  # = 30.0, still fairly lenient vs Tier 1's 60
        'priority': 4                   # Highest priority
    }
]

The check_access_gating() Flow

1. GET /api/cat/feasibility/<region_code> is called
   │
   then
2. Get region's CAT tier from database (e.g Tier 1)
   │
   then
3. Fetch data point for that region from database
   │
   then
4. Call check_access_gating(db, data_point, tier_level = 1)
   │
   then
5. get_active_gating_rules() queries database:
    WHERE tier_level = 1
    AND is_active = True
    ORDER BY priority DESC
   │
   then
6. Returns list of rules for that tier
   │
   then
7. For EACH rule:
    Check access_quality >= min_access_score?
    Check distance_km <= max_distance_km?
    Check travel_time_minutes <= max_travel_time?
    Check access_type in access_types?
   │
   then
8. Result:
    allowed = True (ALL rules passed)
    allowed = False (ANY rule failed)
    failed_rules = List of failures with reasons
    passed_rules = List of passed rules
   │
   then
9. Return JSON response:
   {
     'region_code': 'AK-ANCHORAGE',
     'feasible': True/False,
     'decision': 'FEASIBLE' or 'NOT_FEASIBLE',
     'explanation': '...',
     'failed_gate': '...' (if not feasible)
   }
